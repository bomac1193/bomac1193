**We Are Ubani — Liminal Audio Design House**

### **Sonic systems for the next 10–30 years of Games • Film • TV • Fashion • Experiential Worlds**

Ubani builds **future-facing audio systems** — the kind that power:

* AAA **game worlds**
* High-end **fashion runways & campaigns**
* **Film & TV universes** seeking new sonic identities
* Experiential **art installations & galleries**
* Emerging platforms coming in the next **10–30 years** (spatial web, AI-native media, reactive architecture)

We do not make “tracks.”
We build **living sonic architectures** — systems that respond, mutate and breathe.

## **⌘ Flagship System — *Sonic Motion Engine***

### *Your most commercially valuable project, evolved directly from your existing repos*

**Based on your current GitHub work (Quantum Audio Forge + Unreal experiments), this is the system that positions you for £150K+ deals across games, film, fashion and installations.**

**What it does:**

* Real-time **audio→motion→environment** link
* Generates evolving atmospheres for games, runways, films & galleries
* UE-compatible for next-gen interactive worlds
* Built from your existing tech, refined into a premium, industry-facing identity

→ This system is derived from your **quantum-audio-forge** repo.
We recommend renaming that repo to: **sonic-motion-engine** to reflect value + clarity.

## **⟁ The World We Shape**

Imagine:

* A fashion runway where fabric, light and audio move as one
* A gallery where ambience shifts with viewer presence
* A game world where weather, tension and emotion generate dynamically
* A film or TV universe with an audio identity impossible to imitate

We create the sonic frameworks that turn these ideas into reality.
