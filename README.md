Hi, I’m Alabo — Architect of Sound, Systems & the Unseen

I build worlds you can hear before you see them.

My work lives at the intersection of Audio AI, interactive environments, and the quiet fever-dream of futuristic African noir.
I’m chasing a single question:

What does the future sound like when built by someone who grew up between Lagos, London, church choirs, underground raves, and glitching machines?

Everything here is my attempt to answer that.

✨ My Universe in Code & Sound
🔊 Quantum Audio Forge

A neural sound-sculpting engine built for producers, researchers, and sonic experimenters.

This project began as a personal obsession:
I wanted a machine that didn’t just process audio…
I wanted one that understood it.

Quantum Audio Forge is my experiment in giving sound a living, mutable intelligence:

Neural synthesis + AI timbre transformation

Chain-of-thought audio mutation

Blockchain-verified sound identity

Real-time visualization for seeing sound as if it were matter

→ Explore Quantum Audio Forge

(Expect weird, beautiful, futuristic things.)

🌌 Sonic Metaverse Framework (In Development)

A framework for the future of music worlds.

Born from my love of Unreal’s cinematic worlds and my belief that audio should be more than a background layer — this system aims to:

Generate procedural soundscapes using deep learning

Anchor sound ownership and authenticity with blockchain

Bring spatial audio into game worlds and virtual environments

Allow artists to build living audio ecosystems, not just loops and stems

This is where audio engineering becomes worldbuilding.

🖤 Why I Build

I’m driven by a specific aesthetic and emotional space — a kind of African cyber-gothic futurism.
Blade Runner rain. Lagos heat. Neon scriptures.
Church harmonies warped through modular synths.
Streetwear and mythology.
AI that behaves like a spirit instead of a tool.

I build technology because I want sound to feel like a ritual again — immersive, alive, transformative.

My work sits between:

music producer

creative technologist

sound system designer

machine learning researcher

world-builder

Everything reinforces everything else.

🎛 My Tools (But More Like My Instruments)

I don’t “use tech.”
I treat tech like an extension of my nervous system.

Audio AI & ML
PyTorch • TensorFlow • DDSP • Whisper
Neural timbre models • generative sound design

Audio Systems & DSP
JUCE • C++ DSP • Max/MSP • SuperCollider
UE5 Audio • Wwise • FMOD • real-time signal processing

Creative & Interactive Tools
Unreal Engine • Blender • Web Audio
Unity Audio • Ableton/Pro Tools

Blockchain (for the future of sound identity)
Solidity • Web3.py • on-chain audio verification

🔥 What I’m Exploring Now

Real-time neural synthesis for dynamic game environments

Ritualistic audio in virtual worlds

Blockchain as a new form of musical authorship

Building instruments that respond like living organisms

Making audio that feels spiritual, cinematic, and technologically impossible

🎯 Where I’m Heading (2025)

I want to work with studios, labs, and artists building the next era of interactive sound:

Audio AI R&D

Game audio architecture

Metaverse/world audio systems

Creative technology innovation

Future-of-music research

If it involves shaping the future of sound — I'm interested.
