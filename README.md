We Are Ubani — The Liminal Audio Design House
Audio systems for games, fashion, galleries & immersive worlds

We create sound architectures that transform the spaces they inhabit. From AAA games to runway shows, from contemporary art installations to high-end experiential technology — our work turns audio into a living, reactive presence.

Clients come to us when they need sound that does more than decorate. They come when they need sound that responds, evolves, breathes, and defines identity.

⌘ Our Flagship System — Sonic Motion Engine

A real‑time audio–environment engine built for world‑class experiences.

Designed for:

Luxury fashion runways & brand experiences

Immersive gallery works & installation art

High-end game studios building dynamic audio worlds

Tech companies creating interactive sonic identities

What it does:

Reacts instantly to music, movement, light & space

Generates evolving atmospheres & audio-driven visuals

Integrates with Unreal Engine for large-scale experiences

Behaves like a living ecosystem — not a static tool

This is the project that best represents the type of work we deliver for £150,000+ clients: systems that anchor entire audiovisual worlds.

→ Based on your existing repositories, this system is evolved from your quantum-audio-forge and UE audio experiments — we can rename the repo to sonic-motion-engine for alignment with the industries you want to attract.*

⟡ What We Build

AI-driven audio engines for games & interactive worlds

⟁ The World We Shape

Imagine:

A runway where the lighting breathes with the soundtrack

This is the world of Ubani — where sound is alive.
